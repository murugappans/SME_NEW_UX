How does workflow work? Smepayroll Workflow enables automation of business processes during which documents, information, or tasks are passed from one party to another and actions are performed according to a set of rules. Workflow provides many out-of-the-box components that business users and administrators can use to model their business processes. The following step by step instruction will explain how to implement payroll Workflow in Smepayroll. SCENARIO : ----------------------------------------------------- Company Name: Advanced &amp; Best Technologies Pte Ltd Total Employees: 200 Requirement: Hierarchy structure Payroll authority Level: The senario needs the top level group to be able to view and manager employees belonging to lower levels. The lower level group cannot view or manage employees in top level group ----------------------------------------------------- Step 1: Create Workflow name Click on Add Workflow and enter a Workflow name, we will use WF SCENARIO 1 for this scenario. Step 2: Create Workflow groups Click on Add Workflow Group, enter the names accordingly. Step 3: Create Workflow Levels { Hierarchy} Select the Workflow name from the dropdown list, Select the Workflow type and select the payroll group name created in previous steps. Click on Add Level button to add the levels as shown in the figure below. Step 4:   Assign Employee to Workflow group Select the  payroll Group Name. For Example: Finance Controller Select the employee names from the left grid and Click on Assign button to assign the employee as members of the Finance Controller group.All the employee that are assigned to this group will have Level 1 rights .i.e will be able to view and manage employee from their as well as lower groups. Follow the same steps to assign employee to other groups HR Manager, Assistant HR Manager and HR executive. Step 5:   Assign Employee to Workflow Select the  Workflow level. For Example: WF SCENARIO 1 - L1 { L1 = Level 1} Select the employee names from the left grid and Click on Assign button to assign the employees to the Workflow level WF SCENARIO 1 - L1. All the employee that are assigned to this group will be view and managed by Level 1 payroll Group i.e Finance Controller Group Follow the same steps to assign employee to other Workflow levels WF SCENARIO 1 - L2, WF SCENARIO 1 - L3, WF SCENARIO 1 - L4. Once all the above steps are completed the effects can be viewed in the payroll management. When the user logs into the system to access the payroll module, He /She will only be able to view or manager users belonging on their workflow level or lower. ||how_does_workflow_work.htm","How to add an employee?| Home &gt; Employee Management &gt; How to add an employee?

How to set up leave module? To setup the leave module follow the steps below. The user needs to have Super Admin rights to set up the leaves module as it involves setting up and modifying parameters from Admin, Leave as well as Employee module. Step 1:   Choose the Leave model for your company. Go to Admin Management, Click on Manage Company Inforamtion. Step 2:   Click on edit icon next to the comapny name. Go to Preference Setup Tab Choose one of the 8 different leave models available in the system. Leave Models are broadly divided into 2 categories - Fixed Yearly and Year of service. Fixed Yearly leave model - Leaves period - Calendar year Jaunary to December For Example: Mr. Tan Joins on 1 June 2010. the leave period would be from 1 June 2010 to 31 December 2010,  and the follwoing year January 2011 to Decemeber 2011. Year of Service leave model - Leaves period - Employee's joining anniversary. For Example: Mr. Tan Joins on 1 June 2010. the leave period would be from 1 June 2010 to 30 May 2011, and the following year 1 June 2011 to 30 May 2012. Choosing between Fixed Yearly and Year of Service leave model is very important at this stage as it would define all further modification or additions the user will perform. Fixed Yearly / Year of service - Normal: Under this leave model, all the leaves are available to an employee at any given time of the year. For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of  january or anyother month he/she would have 14 leaves available to consume Fixed Yearly / Year of service - Prorated: Under this leave model, leaves available to an employee are prorated based on number of months of service. For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. The leaves will be prorated by the formula: 14 (Leaves) /12 (Months) = 1.16  *  Number of completed months. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of April he/she would have 3.49 leaves available to consume. (i.e. 14/12 = 1.16 x 3 (Jan,Feb,March) = 3.49) Fixed Yearly / Year of service - Prorated(Floor): Under this leave model, leaves available to an employee are prorated based on number of months of service For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. The leaves will be prorated by the formula: 14 (Leaves) /12 (Months) = 1.16  *  Number of completed months. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of April he/she would have 3 leaves available to consume. (i.e. 14/12 = 1.16 x 3 (Jan,Feb,March) = 3.49 in the concept of floor all the decimal are dropped = 3) Fixed Yearly / Year of service  - Prorated(Ceiling): Under this leave model, leaves available to an employee are prorated based on number of months of service For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. The leaves will be prorated by the formula: 14 (Leaves) /12 (Months) = 1.16  *  Number of completed months. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of April he/she would have 4 leaves available to consume. (i.e. 14/12 = 1.16 x 3 (Jan,Feb,March) = 3.49 in the concept of ceiling the decimal are raised = 4) Step 3: Setting up Leaves Allowed at company level, later we wil setup leaves allowed at employee level. Go to Leave Management, Click on Allowed leave. Based on your selection Fixed yearly or Year of service the following screen will be available. For Fixed Yearly. For Year of service. Step 4: Setting up leaves for employee (For the first time only, there after every year user will use leave transfer option) Go to Employee Management, Click on Employee. Click on edit icon next to the employee name. Go to Leave info tab. Enter Current Year Leaves  and Last year leaves if available for Annual leave for rest of the leave types enter current available leaves and click on Update button. Current available leaves means total leaves available to the employee. The system will automatically prorate leaves if the prorated leave model is selected. Once the leaves are saved the employee will be able to use the application for applying leaves.
