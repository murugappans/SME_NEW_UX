<br />
<strong>Leave Models are broadly divided into 2 categories - Fixed Yearly and Year of service.</strong><br />
<br />
Fixed Yearly leave model - Leaves period - Calendar year Jaunary to December<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">For Example: Mr. Tan Joins on 1 June 2010. the leave period would be from 1 June 2010 to 31 December 2010, <br />
and the follwoing year January 2011 to Decemeber 2011.</span><br />
<br />
Year of Service leave model - Leaves period - Employee's joining anniversary.<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;"><span style="color: #a5a5a5;">For Example: Mr. Tan Joins on 1 June 2010. the leave period would be from 1 June 2010 to 30 May 2011,<br />
and the following year 1 June 2011 to 30 May 2012.<br />
</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Choosing between Fixed Yearly and Year of Service leave model is very important at this stage as it would define all further modification or additions the user will perform.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Fixed Yearly / Year of service - Normal: </strong>Under this leave model, all the leaves are available to an employee at any given time of the year.<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. So if the employee is applying for <br />
leave in the month of  january or anyother month he/she would have 14 leaves available to consume<br />
</span><br />
<strong><strong>Fixed Yearly / Year of service</strong> - Prorated: </strong>Under this leave model, leaves available to an employee are prorated based on number of months of service.<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. The leaves will be prorated by the formula:<br />
14 (Leaves) /12 (Months) = 1.16  *  Number of completed months. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of April he/she would have 3.49 leaves <br />
available to consume. (i.e. 14/12 = 1.16 x 3 (Jan,Feb,March) = 3.49)</span><br />
<br />
</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><strong>Fixed Yearly / Year of service</strong> - Prorated(Floor):</strong> Under this leave model, leaves available to an employee are prorated based on number of months of service<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. The leaves will be prorated by the formula:<br />
14 (Leaves) /12 (Months) = 1.16  *  Number of completed months. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of April he/she would have 3 leaves <br />
available to consume. (i.e. 14/12 = 1.16 x 3 (Jan,Feb,March) = 3.49 in the concept of floor all the decimal are dropped = 3)</span><br />
<br />
<strong><strong>Fixed Yearly / Year of service</strong> - Prorated(Ceiling):</strong> Under this leave model, leaves available to an employee are prorated based on number of months of service<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">For Example: An employee has joined the company on 01. Jan and has 14 Annual leaves entitled for that year. The leaves will be prorated by the formula:<br />
14 (Leaves) /12 (Months) = 1.16  *  Number of completed months. So if the employee is applying for leave in the month of April he/she would have 4 leaves <br />
available to consume. (i.e. 14/12 = 1.16 x 3 (Jan,Feb,March) = 3.49 in the concept of ceiling the decimal are raised = 4)<br />
</span></span><br />
<strong><br />

Go to Leave Management, Click on Allowed leave.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Based on your selection Fixed yearly or Year of service the following screen will be available.<br />
<br />
For Fixed Yearly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For Year of service.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Step 4:<br />
</strong>Setting up leaves for employee (For the first time only, there after every year user will use leave transfer option)<br />
Go to Employee Management, Click on Employee.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/emp.png" /><br />
<br />
Click on edit icon next to the employee name.<br />
Go to Leave info tab.<br />
<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/leave4.png" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Enter Current Year Leaves  and Last year leaves if available for Annual leave for rest of the leave types enter current available leaves and click on Update button.<br />
<span style="color: #a5a5a5;">Current available leaves means total leaves available to the employee. The system will automatically prorate leaves if the prorated leave model is selected.<br />
